Hat-tip to the [Jekyll Garden project](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io), which this repo was forked from. My needs were quite different so it has diverged quite substantially. The premise remains that you publish markdown docs to Github, Jekyll converts those to HTML and are presented in Github pages. 

I'm using the [Obsidian Github Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/) plugin to get documents selectively into Github.

Other than HTML, styles ([tailwind](tailwind.config.js)), HTML and build system ([vite](vite.config.cjs)) there has been a lot of work involved in getting Jekyll to manage alt text for wiki style markdown links:

## Images and Alt Text
That extra work is mostly in `_includes/content.html`. It is now  possible to have a link with a different title to the filename using the wikilink alt text syntax:  
`Read more about the [projects.md|my work]`

And provide custom alt text for images in the same way:
`[project 1.png|Screenshot of an interface]`


## Running project

Two scripts need to be running for local development. One for Jekyll and the other for the Typescript compilation and Vite for tailwind. This could probably be consolidated, but ðŸ¤·  

**Jekyll**  
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0
```

**Typescript & Vite**  
```
npm run dev
```
