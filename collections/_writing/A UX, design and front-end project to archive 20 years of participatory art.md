I was commissioned by artist group Blind Ditch to design and build an online archive of historic and current art work.

They are a collective of artists working in South West England since 1999 making live performance and cultural events. Their work is often technically ambitious, socially engaged and participatory. 

## Constraints and opportunities 

It was interesting and rewarding to work on a non-commercial project with scope to be more collaborative, playful and experimental. However, it still presented a tangible set of constraints based on a demographic of users and stakeholders spread across rural south-west England, as well as in the urban centres. Blind Ditch pride themselves on their ability to present projects in public spaces and engage an audience who may not usually define themselves as art lovers.  

## Working independently

Whilst working as an independent contractor and having to wear many hats I've found it useful to be quite explicit about process. I have over time continued to update a diagram for my personal projects (sometimes during, mostly in retrospect) that helps me reflect on what works and what does not. The intentions is to be critical about my own practice and avoid getting anywhere near [UX Theatre](https://www.spydergrrl.com/2020/05/ux-theatre-poster.html).   


## Themes, values and visual identity

From our initial discussions and throughout a light discovery themes emerged. The themes came through in the work itself, which was document in a variety of mediums and at varying quality, as well as discussions with their collaborators and participants. A rewarding part of this work was being able to hear the passion from all parties that are invited into a participatory artwork.  This lead to a set of principles that defined the work as well as the design of the interface and interactions:

I have also written about the (possibly overstretched) analogy of 'social sculpture', which describes working closely and openly with clients and stakeholders. This becomes even more crucial in scenarios where you are a team of one.


## Aesthetics 

**emerged in the early days of the internet.** The internet as a participatory platform was new and held emancipatory potential. 
In their early years experimented with live networked performance
net.art aesthetics but not overly nostalgic.
