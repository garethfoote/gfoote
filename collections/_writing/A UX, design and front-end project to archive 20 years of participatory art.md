I was commissioned by artist group Blind Ditch to design and build an online archive of their historic and current art work.

They are a collective of artists working in South West England since 1999 making live performance and cultural events. Their work is often technically ambitious, socially engaged and participatory. 

It was interesting and rewarding to work on a non-commercial project with scope to be more collaborative, playful and experimental. However, it still presented a tangible set of constraints based on a demographic of users and stakeholders spread across rural south-west England, as well as in the urban centres. Blind Ditch pride themselves on their ability to present projects in public spaces and engage an audience who may not usually define themselves as art lovers.  

Whilst working as an independent contractor and having to wear many hats I've found it useful to be quite explicit about process. Therefore I have over time continued to update a diagram for each of my projects (sometimes during, mostly in retrospect) that helps to focus my attention.

I have written about working closely with clients closely becoming even more crucial in these scenarios.



In retrospect I created this diagram to describe a design process
