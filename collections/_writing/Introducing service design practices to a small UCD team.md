Throughout 2022-2023, I've been introducing service design practices to a small user-centred design team at The National Archives (TNA). The service is responsible for the selection and transfer of digital records (i.e. digital files) into TNA. This includes the capacity for users to add metadata to individual records to assist with preservation and access or, in the case of sensitive records, to ensure they are 'closed' (i.e. not publicly available). 

## Shifting perspectives

The main digital product that supports the service is designed and built using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and has recently gone through a [service assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work) for public beta. During the lead up to the service assessment a lot of team attention was devoted to design decisions at the page and component scale. Alongside day to day design work, my time was also spent working on documentation and increasing the accessibility standards for the product. (Read more about [[running accessibility audits@#running accessibility audits]]). After we passed our service assessment with glowing colours ðŸ’… we turned to some of the larger scale concerns with the product itself. For example, how to add metadata to individual records for large consignments - i.e. when there are thousands of files and the majority of them need metadata.  

Years before this point there had been a lot of discovery work for the product that took into account the end-to-end service journey. But, whilst striding through the service phases (e.g. alpha, beta, etc) the team will unavoidably narrow their perspective toward the details of individual features or pages, particularly when it is a highly technical product. Although this is necessary, you can find yourself stuck in the details when there is a need for a perspective shift away from the product-focus toward the wider service. Another factor that could encourage this shift is the time since the initial research and discovery, during which the product scope may have shifted. 

As the designer leading on this product, I recognised the need for a wider viewpoint because more complex design challenges arrived and with that came a lot of unanswered questions about the journey a user takes *before* they have come close to our interface. Working closely with a user researcher I started making a case for some 'taking stock' workshop activities as well as building a service blueprint of the service journey. Something that hadn't been done up to this point.   

## Why dedicate time to service design

Within my immediate team and wider department there were no colleagues dedicated to service design activities. It is, like a lot of places, conducted at certain moments and responsibility is spread across various disciplines. My proposal to pause active UI design work for new features whilst we develop a service design approach was met with cautious enthusiasm. I was asked to produce a proposal detailing the and how of this change. This was a good opportunity to go back to basics and think through the mechanisms and principles, asking tricky questions and disentangling the ideas of 'service design' as a discipline from the ubiquitous activities the whole UCD team engages in whilst  designing a service. Speaking to other GOV.UK colleagues in service design it is clear that communicating the value of a practice that is primarily intangible and hard to measure can be a challenge. This is particularly challenging because the outcomes of service design identify problems at a systems level, potentially requiring changes that need buy-in from senior decision makers. 

Here are some of the points I made that are quite universal, however I was keen to emphasise the focus on front-line staff and the idea that looking at the ecosystem, not just the product itself, can bring benefits:

* Create services and products that are as short, efficient and precise as possible
* Identifying time-consuming, burdensome or challenging areas of the service for users and front-line staff 
* To build a richer picture of the service ecosystem by using inclusive and collaborative methods
* Surface the experiences of staff or users to identify problems or opportunities in the service 
* To create a collective understanding of the end-to-end flow of information and data
* Reduce the repetition of journeys, processes and data entry
* Increase user confidence, reduce journeys that end in dissatisfaction or error, and reduce workload for front-line staff

## Determining scope and ambition

Whilst there is an understandable impetus to try to capture and therefore understand the complexity of a system in as much detail as possible there are good reasons to not do attempt this. For one, any map that tries to replicate the territory on a 1:1 scale is no longer a map. It's a like-for-like representation. Mapping is an intentional simplification and abstraction so that complexity can be more easily understood. The diagram below is a useful reminder of the challenge of mapping across the complexity <> simplicity spectrum:

![[Introducing service design practices to a small UCD team-20231221100700552.png@#Two illustrations of maps, one is too complex, the other too simple]]

The diagram is from a paper called [Designing Controversies and Their Publics](https://hal.science/hal-01672300/document) by Tommaso Venturini, Donato Ricci, Michele Mauri, Lucy Kimbell and Axel Meunier. 

Another diagram (below) from [James Kalbach's Mapping Experiences](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mapping-experiences/9781491923528/) is helpful in understanding the scope and formality of your service mapping ambitions. If you are in a product-focused design team and you are trying to push for time to research and understand user journeys beyond the interface then setting the scope toward the top right of the chart below is important. However, as a pilot activity designed to prove the efficacy of the methods you may need to avoid sprawling scope and ambition. In my case, we had a well targeted and limited ambition to zoom out from the product to look specifically at how **users prepare for a digital transfer**. To do this we moved beyond the individual and team scope and researched more of the organisation (i.e. the backstage), which connects to the defined user activity.   
![[determine-level-of-formality-kalbach.png@#A graph which ranges from producing a single product to providing service ecosystems on the horizontal axis. And movement from the design of interfaces to holistic experiences on the vertical axis.]]

As stated in the figure caption above there is a need for more formal modelling (i.e. visualisation methods) the closer you get to capturing an ecosystem experience, opposed to an interface or product user journey. 

## Activities and intended outcomes

* Tapping into existing user research
* Working closely with front-line staff
* Interviews with backstage staff
* Workshop to define rough map
	* The co-production of the map was as insightful as the artefact itself
* Draft created, reviewed
* Version 1 created. 
* Shared wider with insights 
* Still work in progress

- Approach
- Outcomes

- Reasons (Individual)
	- Working at the micro level without a view on the position of the user when they reach that touchpoint, page or component
- Reasons (Organisational)
	- A department that has historically focused on creating robust, effective and efficient technology. Also, heavily driven by process, policy and staff with domain expertise. 
	- In recent years moving into a space of user-centred digital services.
	- Products are first and foremost oriented around the capacity of new technology, i.e. sending documents over the network replacing sending them on a hard drive. 


- Transfer support staff are often engaged in 121 support of complex processes, guiding users in the use of software and helping them understand technical or organisational requirements. 

- In user research, it is clear that our end users see that they are providing us (i.e. the organisation) with a service. Potentially this is due to the complexity and burden our service and product puts onto the user.
