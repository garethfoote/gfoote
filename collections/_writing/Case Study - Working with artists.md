I was commissioned by an arts collective called Blind Ditch to perform the research, UX, design and build for an online archive of their 20 years of experimental performance and social art.

I had worked with Blind Ditch previously as a technologist on their Museum of Contemporary Commodities project. I was familiar with the type of work they create and the audiences and participants they tend to engage. The project was funded by the Arts Council England.

This was one of the last projects I created as a 'one man band' and therefore an exercise in doing all the parts of a design and development process individually. The challenges of working this way are mostly that you have to impose your own structure (process, deadline, standards) and that there is little collaboration with other designers. 

Self-imposed structure is something I can do and the case study about this project got me a job at The National Archives. You can see that in this presentation:

The other challenge, a lack of design collaboration, gave rise to a working relationship with the client (Blind Ditch) that was more involved than a typical client and service provider. And, in fact, the loss of any specialised, commercial 'design' experience was more than compensate by the attention paid to collaboration and the co-creation (of knowledge and designed outcomes). 

## Production as a social sculpture

I have often reflected on why this was such a productive collaboration. I have had very similar positive experiences working as a collaborator/technologist on art projects in the past. In my opinion the common denominator is how artists create an environment for co-production. Admittedly, this will not be a universal truth, but still something I would like to simulate in whatever type of creative practice I participate in. Most of these projects had a significant social or participatory element to their outcomes therefore the normal and expected mode of production is to be explicitly inclusive, flatten hierarchies and emphasise the social elements of the creative process. 

It reminded me of Joseph Beuys' idea of social sculptures. As an artist and teacher he saw the educational space as something shaped together by the ideas, actions and interactions within it. He would have a semi-prepared structure for these *lecture actions* and document them on a blackboard

effectively "that life is a social sculpture that everyone helps to shape". 

There is something maybe to naive 

There is no lack of efforts in the design, digital and UX arenas to forcibly encourage collaboration, and a lot of them are quite successful. 







Both education and truly co-creative work reminds me of the

Why build a micro-design system? 
* For many years working as an independent contractor I have found myself working mostly in established teams where design process is well established (albeit not always effective) or as an individual, sole design working direct to clients. In neither case is there much opportunity to build best practice from start
