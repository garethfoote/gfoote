## Arrival 
Your key is with my neighbours Willa and Kevin at Flat 8. When you arrive dial their number on the keypad (then the little bell symbol) and one of them will give you a key. 

If you need anything please get in touch with me on 07843432991 on WhatsApp. 

## Wi-Fi
Network: **VFAST GF**  
Password: **33967059**
## Bedroom
You're in the last bedroom along the corridor before you reach the living area (4th door along). When you arrive it will be open and other's should be closed. It has black and white bedsheets and light green walls. There are some empty draws and space in the cupboards to hang clothes. There will be towels on the bed. 

## Housemates
Jen is in the first room the front door. She is very lovely and will be welcoming. If you're stuck for something you can ask her but better to give me a message or call first. 
### Tecka the Cat
 She is an indoor cat but if the weather is good and you have the patio door open, she will go outside onto the shared terrace. She's shy but very friendly when you get to know her. Give her some time and she will warm up.  
 
 Her food and water are in the kitchen. If you want to befriend her or I'm out of the house feel free to feed her. She has 2 or 3 pouches of wet food a day and her dry food is kept topped up.
## Bathroom
Your bathroom is across from the main bedroom. Feel free to use any shower gel, shampoo/conditioner and toothpaste that you find. There is a button on the outside of the door, next to the light switch that turns on the ventilation. If it's steamy turn that on for a while. 
## Kitchen

### Tea and Coffee
There's an unopened silver tin of illy coffee on the shelf where the cookbooks are and tea in a ceramic pot by the microwave. Help yourself to that.
### Dishwasher
You can use the dishwasher for most things but avoid putting the sharp knives in there. The dishwasher tablets are underneath the sink. 
### Recycling
There is food waste recycling to the right of the sink in a brown plastic container and mixed recycling is in the cupboard underneath the food waste. There are separate recycling bins but you can put any glass, paper, and most plastic into any of them. Don't worry about separating. 
## The Terrace
Help yourself to the use of the terrace. There is a table with a few chairs and a sofa area to sit. The key to the patio door will be in the door. When the bar is pointing all the way up the door is unlocked. It occasionally gets a bit stiff and the bar will only go half way up. If that happens you may need to lock and unlock with the key to make it work.  

## Living Room
### Using the TV
If you want to use the TV, it is turned on with the Samsung remote, then click 'PC' on the Onkyo remote, and, finally click the middle button on the smallest Fire TV remote.
### Playing music
If you are on the WiFi and you have Spotify you can easily play music through the speakers in the living room. All you need to do is open Spotify, click the little icon with a speaker on it and select the Onkyo device.  
## Washing machine
The second door along the corridor has a washing machine. Feel free to use that. There is washing liquid on a shelf above the machine.
