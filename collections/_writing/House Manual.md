### Tecka the Cat
 She is an indoor cat but if the weather is good and you have the patio door open, she will go outside onto the shared terrace. 
 
 Her food and water are in the kitchen. She has 2 or 3 cartons of wet food a day and you can fill up her dry food whenever it is getting low. Her water needs filing up every couple of days. 
 
 She has a cat litter tray and you will notice when that needs scooping into the nearby toilet. Sadly, in her old age, she has given up on burying her 'business'. There will be plenty of fresh cat litter to cover up wee. It starts to get a bit full every 3 or 4 days. If you are staying that long and it needs changing there are replacement litter tray liners/bags and more litter in the utility room where the washing machine is. Ideally, the dirty cat litter goes into the bins in the main bin room. 
 
 ### Bin room
 If you need to access the bin room, turn right out of the lift/stairwell and go all the way at the end of the corridor through two doors. The second door needs a key which should be by the front door marked XXXXXX. 

### Washing machine
Feel free to use the washing machine. There is washing liquid

### The Terrace
Help yourself to the use of the terrace. There is a table with a few chairs and a sofa area to sit. The key to the patio door will be in the door. When the bar is pointing all the way up the door is unlocked. It occasionally gets a bit stiff and you need to lock and unlock with the key to make it work.  

### Using the TV
If you want to use the TV, it is turned on with the Samsung remote, then click 'PC' on the Onkyo remote, and, finally click the middle button on the smallest Fire TV remote.

### Playing music
If you are on the WiFi and you have Spotify you can easily play music through the speakers in the living room. All you need to do is open Spotify, click the little icon with a speaker on it and select the Onkyo device.
