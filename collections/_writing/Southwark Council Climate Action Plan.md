I worked with Dr. Lara Salinas, co-director of Service Futures Lab at London College of Communication, on a project that mapped the Climate Action Plan of departments within Southwark Council. 

Co-design activities were run with Southwark’s Climate Change team. The outcomes of this were a static visualisation (created by a PhD student from LCC), which detailed the relationship between departments, actions being taken and the council’s climate priorities.

Working with the LCC team, I was responsible for determining the best way to support the Climate Action department in using this information to support their goals. For example, to facilitate further collaborations across teams, to surface neglected climate priorities, and to recognise and celebrate good work.


Below are some of the artefacts produced including user stories, content mapping exercises, and a high-fidelity, interactive prototype.
