For the 21/22 winter semester on BA UXD I designed and taught a unit on Interactive Data Visualisation. I choose to model this on a unit taught by the [Density Design Lab](https://densitydesign.org/) at Politecnico Di Milano. They wrote an excellent paper called [Teaching the critical role of designers in the data society: the DensityDesign approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339884430_Teaching_the_critical_role_of_designers_in_the_data_society_the_DensityDesign_approach), which laid out the theoretical and practical foundations of the teaching. 

At the core is a method created by Bruno Latour called Controversy Mapping as way to help students understand, observe and describe socio-technical debates.
