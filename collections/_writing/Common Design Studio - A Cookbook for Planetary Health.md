My role in this project was organiser, facilitator and speaker. I worked closely with designers and educators from London, Barcelona and Melbourne. My colleagues and I have been building relationships with overseas partners for many years that involved exchanges to and from the far corners of the planet for a handful of staff and students. Before the pandemic forced us online, we decided to create an annual design sprint using remote collaborative tools to expand the participation and give our students the chance to regularly work with emerging designers outside of London. The ambitions of the project were to help us and our students understand seemingly intractable, global problems from diverse local perspectives. Each year the theme would change but the overall design sprint framework remained. 

This acts as both a case study in running design sprints, the use of service design methodologies in design education and also a loose description of the framework we created, which was designed to be replicated in other contexts. My colleagues Tobias Revell and Dr Eva Verhoeven [wrote a paper that dives into the pedagogic learning from this project](https://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/id/eprint/14432/). 

## Theme: Radical Gardening in Urban Spaces

Here is an example of a brief written by myself and colleagues: 

> This year the CDS theme continues the focus on the potential for design to encourage positive action for planetary health. The 3 participating institutions are all situated in cities with diverse characters, histories, and physical and human geography. One commonality between these (if not all) cities is their position as epicentres of continuous growth into nature - often with beginnings as small settlements cities evolve into a form of ‘urban terraforming’. The urban sprawl into former sites of ecological biodiversity is not easily reversed so cities create their own internal green spaces. Often these are either sanctioned public space with limited freedoms (by bylaws, etc) or privately owned with no access at all. Historically these have been, by design, for leisure or aesthetics, rather than any planetary benefit. In this design brief you are challenged to consider gardening as a radical and social act within urban spaces that considers design for the planet as well as diverse human needs. How can we design ‘recipes’ to encourage beneficial social and ecological use of existing green spaces or to reclaim and create new sites for radical gardening? Actions to prevent further environmental degradation as well as effects on human health are innately social and therefore these recipes need to be actioned communally. Continuing the format of last year’s CDS we ask you to work within the frame of a cookbook full of recipes that can incite positive collective action and encourage creative resistance within the framing of the radical garden space.     

Here is the thematic briefing for this topic created by myself and my colleague, Laura Lovell-Anderson.

## Recipes for a Planetary Health Cookbook

To avoid the pitfalls of design solutionism when addressing global problems we framed the outcomes as 'recipes for action' that had to be documented and tested in each locale before they could be added to an ongoing Planetary Health Cookbook. The recipes could take many forms including field guides, advise, hacks, tips and tricks, tutorials, cautionary tales, coping mechanisms, training exercises, manifestos or collective actions.

The idea of recipes appealed to us as the project organisers for a number of reasons - recipes should be designed as simple, accessible instructions; they require testing and iteration by the recipe designer; they often (but not always) include locally specific ingredients and cultural or social context; and there is a long history of radical cookbooks used in the arts and social activism.

## Mapping the problem space

Mapping exercises were a significant part of the process throughout the design sprint. We encouraged students to map the problem domain from a conceptual and research perspective. We encouraged participants to make use systems mapping techniques to evaluate factors surrounding a given issue and find the leverage points that may affect its overall behaviour.

## Outcomes
In this context a recipe is a simple set of reproducible instructions to reach a specific goal, which was related to the theme. The recipes were collected into a cookbook, which took the form of a [website](https://www.commondesignstudio.net/). This was created to contain, present and distribute the recipes, with each recipe consisting of a ‘recipe card’ giving the basic instructions and a video that demonstrates the use or reasoning for its creation.

History
* During the previous two iterations of CDS students have been encouraged to create design proposals in the form of ‘recipes’ that can incite positive collective action and encourage creative resistance. The recipes are designed to be oriented toward community-level activations and be accessible, adaptable and transferable across location, language and culture. The student groups are working in various locations on the same issue and therefore benefit from each others’ diverse experience.
* Students are encouraged to enact proposals in their local communities then bring this highly localised experiential knowledge back to help generate a globally translatable outcome. While the outcomes are quick sketches for innovation, the studio experience itself provides a ‘recipe’ for enabling adaptation-orientated designers.

Introduction
- The Common Design Studio (previously Global Design Studio) is an international collaborative design sprint that explores global and wicked problems and challenges. For several years the studio has engaged students and lecturers from RMIT University, London College of Communication and Elisava (Barcelona), along with industry and research experts.
