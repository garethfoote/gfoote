## Tecka the Cat
 She is an indoor cat but if the weather is good and you have the patio door open, she will go outside onto the shared terrace. She's shy but very friendly when you get to know her. Give her some time (and treats) and she will warm up.  
 
 Her food and water are in the kitchen. If you want to befriend her or I'm out of the house feel free to feed her. She has 2 pouches of wet food a day, 1 in the morning and evening. Sometimes she gets an extra one at lunch. 
 
 She has two cat litter trays, 1 in the living room and corridor.  If I'm out and you notice she has done her business then you're more than welcome to scoop into the nearby toilet. But don't worry if not, I'll deal with it when I'm back. 

## Bin room
 If you need to access the bin room, turn right out of the lift or stairwell and go all the way to the end of the corridor through two doors. The second door needs a key, which will be by the door attached to a heavy bike tool.  
## Bathrooms
Feel free to use any shower gel, shampoo/conditioner and toothpaste that you find. There is a button on the outside of the door, next to the light switch that turns on the ventilation. If it's steamy turn that on for a while. 
## Washing machine
Feel free to use the washing machine. There is washing liquid on a shelf above the machine.
## Kitchen

### Food
Help yourself to things like olive oil, butter, jams, peanut butter, and honey. 
### Dishwasher
You can use the dishwasher for most things but avoid putting the sharp knives in there. The dishwasher tablets are underneath the sink. 
### Recycling
There is food waste recycling to the right of the sink in a brown plastic container and mixed recycling is in the cupboard underneath the food waste. There are separate recycling bins but you can put any glass, paper, and most plastic into any of them. Don't worry about separating. 
## The Terrace
Help yourself to the use of the terrace. There is a table with a few chairs and a sofa area to sit. The key to the patio door will be in the door. When the bar is pointing all the way up the door is unlocked. It occasionally gets a bit stiff and the bar will only go half way up. If that happens you may need to lock and unlock with the key to make it work.  
## Using the TV
If you want to use the TV, it is turned on with the Samsung remote, then click 'PC' on the Onkyo remote, and, finally click the middle button on the smallest Fire TV remote.

## Playing music
If you are on the WiFi and you have Spotify you can easily play music through the speakers in the living room. All you need to do is open Spotify, click the little icon with a speaker on it and select the Onkyo device.
