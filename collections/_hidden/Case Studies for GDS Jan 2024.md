These are a selection of case studies that give an insight into my design practice and professional experience. I work as an Interaction, UX and Service Designer so these case studies represent a cross-section of these disciplines.

This website is a work-in-progress so is not fully populated yet. However, feel free to read some recent [[Weeknotes@#weeknotes]], look through a small selection of my [[Teaching@#work as a design educator]] or some [[Installation@#older installation work]].
