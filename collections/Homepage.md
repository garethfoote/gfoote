I’m a designer working at [The National Archives](), with a background in front-end development and UX. I’m also an educator, having worked as a lecturer and course leader for an [undergrad UX course](). 

This is space for me to develop a regular practice of writing about [subjects of interest](), show old and start new [experiments](), and write up [case studies]() of professional work.
