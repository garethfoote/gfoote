Iâ€™m a designer working at [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/), with a background in service design, UX, interaction design, and design education. Until summer of 2022 I was a senior lecturer and course leader for an [undergraduate UX course](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/animation-interactive-film-and-sound/undergraduate/ba-hons-user-experience-design-lcc). This is space for me to develop a regular writing practice about subjects of interest, show [[Installation@#old work]], start new experiments, and write up [[Case Study@#case studies]] of professional work. Read a little more [[About@#about me]].
